### ProMED alert mapping

This is an exploration of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to map the email alerts from ProMED. The Project for Monitoring Emerging Diseases ([ProMED](https://promedmail.org/about-promed/)) was launched in 1994 and is still active.<br>
I learned about this service from David Quammen's book <i>Breathless</i>, which I highly recommend to everyone.<br>
The app is currently hosted using Streamlit Community Cloud at [https://mapping-promed-alerts.streamlit.app/](https://mapping-promed-alerts.streamlit.app/)
